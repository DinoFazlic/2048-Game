# 2048 Game
This project is a Java implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game, where the player combines tiles with matching numbers to reach the elusive 2048 tile. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and the objective is to slide the tiles and combine them until a tile with the number 2048 is created.

# Features
Grid-based gameplay: 4x4 grid where tiles slide and combine based on user input.
Tile merging: Matching tiles (e.g., two '2' tiles) combine into a new tile with double the value (e.g., '4').
Random tile generation: After every valid move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) appears randomly on the grid.
Game over condition: The game ends when the grid is full and no more valid moves are possible.
Winning condition: The player wins when a tile with the value 2048 is created.
User-friendly interface: Simple text-based interface (or graphical UI, if implemented).
